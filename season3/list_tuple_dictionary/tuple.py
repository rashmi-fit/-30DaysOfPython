# list of values grouped together

point= (10, 20, 30)
# tuple is immutable
print(point[0])  # Accessing the first element
print(point[1])  # Accessing the second element
print(point[2])  # Accessing the third element

# values have different meaning means heterogenous
# eg coordinates of a point
# tuple can be used to represent a point in 3D space
# immutable means you cannot change the values of a tuple
